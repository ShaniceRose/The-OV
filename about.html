                <h3 class="header">Fun Fact:</h3>
                <p class="response">The OmniVerse not only houses comics, manga and nerd pop culture novelties, but it also makes a safe space for all nerds to build a community!</p>
              
                <h3 class="header">1. Cool, so...what is The OmniVerse?</h3>
                <p class="response">The OmniVerse is basically a one stop shop for not only reading material such as manga, comics, and other nerd pop culture novelties, but it also allows a safe space for nerds to interact, from all backgrounds. We pride ourselves on wanting to make our community easily accessible, while you may want to catch up on your favorite or new comic/ manga. </p>
              
                <h3 class="header">2. So who are you guys anyway? </h3>
                <p class="response">First, let us formally introduce ourselves, I am Shanice Rose, the creator and  my lovely partner, Keenan Pledger is the Co-Creator. Weâ€™re both nerds who thrive on new experiences and indulging in our quirky, nerdy finds to share amongst other quirky nerdy finders! We came up with the idea randomly one day while visiting a comic shop. We realized that since making comics and manga digital, a lot of traffic that we usually find in a comic shop, isn't there anymore, except on occasional days like free comic book day. At that point we also realized that we missed interacting with other nerds like ourselves, until we remembered social media is a thing. We decide to create an online store, while merging a social media aspect to it.   </p>
              
                <h3 class="header"> 3. When can we expect a launch date?</h3>
          
                <p class="response">We are currently building an app that will be accessible on every mobile device while, creating a webpage. The two are interchangeable as to which will happen first, but expect to have a launch by 2021! Hard work and dedication will pay off, and when we launch, we want to make sure that is a visually wonderful experience you'll have!</p> <br>
